# AI

## A quick note about AI. 
>I have not been using any LLM on any projects in any repo. However I have been instructed to learn how to use it, and use it, at work by my senior devs.
As such, I have been learning prompt engineering and plan to continue learning more. This repo will be posted in case anyone checking my profile is interested in my future endeavors. I currently don't have any LLM/ML projects in the pipeline. Feel free to check out my [Python](https://github.com/markwmc/Python) repo for current projects that may lead me closer to adding something related to this to the backlog.
